# PHYSICS 5300 Final Project

This repository contains my final project for PHYS 5300.

The project models a simplified one-dimensional kinetic chain representing energy transfer during a straight punch, using a coupled mass–spring system. Normal modes, driven dynamics, and energy transfer are analyzed using numerical integration.

## Contents
- `final_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full derivations, simulations, and discussion.

## Notes
All figures and results can be reproduced by running the notebook from top to bottom.
